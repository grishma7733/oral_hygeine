# Oral Hygiene Plaque Detection Web Application

## Project Overview
This web application uses advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to analyze dental images and detect plaque severity. Leveraging YOLO object detection and image processing algorithms, the app provides detailed insights into oral health.

## Features
- Image upload for dental analysis
- Plaque detection and segmentation
- Severity classification of plaque
- Visual representation of plaque levels
- Quantitative analysis of plaque percentages

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask
- OpenCV
- Ultralytics YOLO
- Pillow (PIL)
- HTML/CSS

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Flask
- OpenCV
- Ultralytics
- NumPy
- Pillow

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/oral-hygiene-app.git
```

2. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application
```bash
python app.py
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser

## How It Works
- Upload a dental image
- The application processes the image
- Detects and segments plaque
- Classifies plaque severity:
  - Mild
  - Moderate
  - Severe
- Provides percentage breakdown of plaque levels

## Plaque Severity Metrics
- Color-coded visualization
- Precise percentage calculations
- Visual representation of oral health status

## Future Improvements
- Enhanced machine learning model
- More detailed plaque analysis
- Support for multiple image formats
- Integration with dental records
